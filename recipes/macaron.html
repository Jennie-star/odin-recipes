	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>These French macarons are a labor of love and we did a lot of </p>
	<p>research to perfect this recipe for you, after our own failures.</p>
	<p> Please follow as written and you will have a delicious and</p>
	<p> well-presented cookie. You may wish to experiment with different</p>
	<p> fillings. Enjoy!</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<h4>Macarons</h4>
	 <ul>
	  <li>3 extra-large egg whites</li>
	  <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
	  <li>1 ⅔ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
	  <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
	  <li>1 pinch salt</li>
	 </ul>
	<h4>Buttercream Filling</h4>
	 <ul>
	  <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
	  <li>⅔ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
	  <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
	 </ul>
	<h3>Steps</h3>
	 <ol>
	  <li><p>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking</p>
	      <p> sheet with parchment paper.</p></li>
	  <li><p>Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl with an electric</p>
	      <p> mixer on medium speed until foamy, about 30 seconds. Add white sugar</p>
	      <p> and continue to beat until peaks are stiff enough and stay in place</p>
	      <p> when the bowl is turned upside down, about 5 minutes.</p></li>
	  <li><p>Sift 1 2/3 cup confectioners' sugar, almond flour, and salt together</p>
	      <p> twice. Fold into egg whites until batter is creamy and falls slowly </p>
	      <p>off the lifted spatula, about 50 turns with a spatula. Transfer batter</p>
	      <p> to a piping bag fitted with a round tip.</p></li>
	  <li><p>Pipe batter onto the parchment paper, using a circular motion to make</p>
	      <p> macarons 1 inch in diameter. Tap the baking sheet against the counter</p>
	      <p> about 10 times to release any air bubbles.</p></li>
	  <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven for 9 minutes. Rotate the baking sheet and</p>
	      <p> continue baking until macarons are shiny and rise slightly to form feet</p>
	      <p> (ruffles around the edge), about 9 minutes more. Peel off parchment paper</p>
	      <p> and allow to cool completely, about 30 minutes.</p></li>
	  <li><p>Beat butter, 2/3 cup confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract with an electric</p>
	      <p> mixer until creamy and thick, about 10 minutes. Transfer filling to a piping bag</p>
	      <p> fitted with a round tip.</p></li>
	  <li><p>Pipe a small amount of filling in the center on the flat side of 1 macaron; top with</p>
	      <p> another macaron and press gently to sandwich together.</p></li>
	 </ol>
